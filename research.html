    We conduct research and studies using mainly qualitative (ethnographic) methods - interviews, focus groups, observations. But we also do small quantitative analyzes, for example, we create and analyze questionnaires. <br
    We emphasize and follow the anthropological research principles and ethics that it is important to understand the perspective of the researched or targeted group by a political, social or business initiative, and to work as much as possible together with communities, researched groups and different stakeholders.<br>

      <b>RESEARCH FOR DOCUMENTARY ON WATCHING LATIN AMERCAN SOAP OPERAS IN LITHUANIA (ongoing)</b>
  
 <div class="ataskaitos">
  <p>
  Do you remember Escrava Isaura, Gata Salvaje and other series specially shown and watched since 80's, 90's and 2000's? A documentary about this phenomenon is currently being made by Lithuanian film production company "Just a Moment". For the creation of the script, Anthropos is conducting a research about the phenomenon of watching telenovelas (soap operas) in Lithuania. We are interested in how we can look at the first decade of Independance (since 90's) - the everyday life, difficulties and joys, people's experiences and try to understand the huge boom of these telenovelas throughout Eastern Europe at the time. The study is funded by the film studio "Just a Moment". The directors of the film are Ieva Balsiūnaitė and Viktorija Mickutė, the producer is Dagne Vildžiūnaitė.<br>

      <b>OPPORTUNITY STUDY OF ABANDONED SOVIET CHILDREN SUMMER CAMP "VĖTRUNGĖ“ RENEWAL IN KINTAI (2021 m.)</b>
  
 <div class="ataskaitos">
  <p>
  We prepared an opportunity study of the possibilities of organizational activities in organization of the activities of the currently abandoned children's camp "Vėtrungė" in Kintai. In this study, we aimed to understand the experiences of children’s camp organizers and campers to respond possible infrastructural needs and to develop a management model. We also took into account the mega trends of society development, emerging challenges and needs, as well as the specifics of the camp managing institution - the vocational school and the possible unique contribution to the organization of activities. We provided guidelines for the development of the camp, a vision for the camp, and three management options with their strengths and weaknesses.<br>
  During the study, we conducted a qualitative study - semi-structured interviews with camp organizers and campers. We also analyzed the documents regulating the activities of the camps, organized meetings and workshops with different stakeholder groups: Šilutė City Municipality, Šilutė Vocational Training Center and the Kintai community. We also examined foreign examples and got a lot of inspiration from Danish Folk schools model.<br>
  The project was funded by the Public Institution Šilutė Vocational Training Center.<br>

      <b>PARTICIPANTS’ EVALUATION BY SYRVEY OF THE MO MUSEUM PROJECT "EXCHANGE OF VISUAL THINKING IN ART: PROJECT FOR TEACHERS" 
      <br>(2021, 2022 m.)</b>
  
 <div class="ataskaitos">
  <p>The Visual Thinking Strategy is a method developed by the educator and psychologist at the MoMA Museum (USA). The MO Museum uses it in its work in the museum and has adapted and conducted educations for teachers to work with pupils. Teachers are invited to incorporate more visual, art and museum material into the curriculum to develop pupils' competencies in creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, communication and collaboration.<br>
      We conducted a self-assessment questionnaire for project participants. During the research, we prepared a questionnaire based on the material studied during the training, aimed at acquiring competencies. As well as conducted a quantitative analysis of the questionnaires of ~ 130 participants.
